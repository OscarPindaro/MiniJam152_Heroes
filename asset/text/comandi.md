In this game, your objective is to serve delicious food to a horde of heros.
Every hero comes from a different race or background that will determine their preferences on food.

The restaurant is splitted into two areas:
- The dining room, where heroes come and express their preferences while speaking with their friends. If you are close enough, you may even be able to know their specific tastes.
- The kitchen, where food is prepared and cooked. A dish consists of a main ingredient (meat, fish, eggplant or mushrooms), a preparation (fried, diced or grilled) and a side (salad, tomatoes or french fries). 


Your job is to gather the heroes' preferences and try to find the two dishes that will satisfy the highest number of clients. You will not be able to satisfy everybody, but you can try to maximize the overall satisfaction. 
When a dish is ready, expose it on the kitchen counter. Remember, even if the two slots are full, you can still create new dishes and expose them!
