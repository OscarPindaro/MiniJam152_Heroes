Move! Move! THERE IS NO TIME!!!!
It's rush hour here at Dungeon Kitchen, and even though our food is the best in the whole kingdom, our service still needs to be improved.

The first customers are coming.
"After all that fighting and adventuring, i really need a hot and nutrituios meal. I hope that today the Dungeon Kitchen is offering something inviting and appetizing. They are very famous for their broad offering, I'm sure I will not be disappointed!! AHAH", you hear them say.

Your anxiety builds up.
As always, corporate left us understaffed and low on stocks.
A terrible news today came: to increse shareholders satisfaction, now the Dungeon Kitchen will ONLY serve TWO ITEMS on the menu. 
The waiter was fired, and you are on your own now.
There are too much heroes. Everybody wants something different, it will be impossible to please everybody.

Remember to smile to the customer!
